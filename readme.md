# Document Q\&A Chatbot üß†

Hey there\! I'm Sharath, and welcome to my Document Q\&A project.

Ever felt the pain of searching through a huge PDF or text file for just one piece of information? I built this tool to solve that. You can just **upload your documents and ask them questions directly**. Think of it as having a conversation with your files.

This project is open-source, and you can find all the code right here: [https://github.com/mr-sharath/document\_RAG](https://github.com/mr-sharath/document_RAG)

## How It Works Under the Hood üõ†Ô∏è

So, how does it all come together? It's not magic, but it's close\!

I'm using a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Here‚Äôs the simple breakdown:

1.  **Ingestion & Chunking**: When you upload a document, the app first breaks down the text into smaller, manageable chunks.
2.  **Embedding & Indexing**: Each chunk is then converted into a numerical representation (a vector) using **OpenAI's** powerful models. These vectors are stored in a super-fast searchable database called **FAISS**.
3.  **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the app converts your question into a vector and uses FAISS to find the most relevant text chunks from your document.
4.  **Generation**: Finally, it hands your question and the relevant chunks over to an **OpenAI LLM (like GPT-3.5)** with a simple instruction: "Answer this question using *only* this information."

This process ensures the answers are fast, accurate, and grounded in the content of your documents. The whole thing is tied together with **LangChain** and served up through a simple web UI built with **Gradio**.

## Getting It Running on Your Machine üöÄ

Ready to try it yourself? Just follow these steps.

### 1\. Grab the Code

First, you'll need to clone the repository to get the code on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-sharath/document_RAG.git
cd document_RAG
```

### 2\. Install the Dependencies

This project relies on a few key Python libraries. You can install them all with this one command:

```bash
pip install gradio langchain faiss-cpu PyMuPDF openai tiktoken langchain-openai langchain-community python-dotenv
```

### 3\. Add Your OpenAI API Key

To connect to OpenAI's models, you'll need an API key.

  * Create a new file in the project's main folder and name it `.env`
  * Open the file and add your API key like this:

<!-- end list -->

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretKeyGoesHere"
```

The app is set up to load this key automatically, so your key stays safe and isn't hard-coded.

### 4\. Launch the App\!

You're all set. Run the main script from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see some startup messages, and then a URL will appear (something like `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open that link in your browser to start using the chatbot.

## How to Use the Chatbot üí¨

The interface is designed to be super simple:

1.  **Upload a File**: On the left, click to upload a `.pdf` or `.txt` file.
2.  **Wait a Moment**: You'll see a status message once the file has been processed and is ready for questions.
3.  **Ask Anything**: Type your question into the chatbox on the right and hit Enter.

That's it\! The bot will answer based on the document you provided.
